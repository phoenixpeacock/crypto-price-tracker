# crypto-price-tracker

Django Crypto Tracker is a responsive web application that displays real-time cryptocurrency prices by integrating with the CoinGecko API. Built using the Django framework, this project demonstrates how backend and frontend technologies can work together to build a modern, dynamic crypto monitoring dashboard.

**The application uses Djangoâ€™s MVT architecture:**

Models manage and store coin data using Django ORM.

Views handle the logic to fetch and update coin prices via RESTful API calls.

Templates render clean UI components with a touch of interactivity.

AJAX is used to fetch updated crypto prices without reloading the page, ensuring a smooth and real-time user experience. The frontend is enhanced with a parallax scrolling effect, giving the app a more modern and engaging feel.
